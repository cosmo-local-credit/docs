## **15. Roadmap (Indicative)**



* **v1**: CLC token launch; CLC Pool; fee adapters; governance MVP (quorum + timelocks).
* **v1.1: Router SDK & registry APIs; health dashboards; Insurance Fund policy v1; opt-in rebalance intents + batch netting (cycle-finding) MVP.**
* **v1.2**: Cross-domain routing via HTLC/escrow; guarantor module; tiered limit presets.
* **v2: Retail on/off-ramps (via regulated partners), personal micro-pools;** compliance plugin marketplace; third-party audits of voucher classes.
    * **- On-ramps:** convert fiat → approved stable cash-equivalents that can seed designated pools.
    * **Off-ramps:** convert approved cash-equivalent stables → fiat via an approved off-ramp list (bank transfer, e-money issuers, and card-issuing/payment processors on major card rails), with jurisdictional KYC/attestation and geofencing where required.
    * **Principle:** the DAO and CPP pools do not operate fiat rails; ramps are provided by licensed third parties under local regulation.
