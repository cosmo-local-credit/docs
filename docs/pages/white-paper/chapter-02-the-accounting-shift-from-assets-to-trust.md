## **2. The Accounting Shift: From Assets to Trust**

Traditional finance begins with **Assets − Liabilities = Equity**. CPP reframes this for a commitment economy:



* **Credit Access**: How much the network is still willing to accept from you.
* **Outstanding Commitments (Debt)**: Your unfulfilled promises held by others.
* **Backing Capacity**: Your real ability to honor those promises.

**Commitment–Capacity Identity:**
Credit − Debt = Backing Capacity

This identity governs risk, limits, and safety across pools: unlimited issuance does not imply unlimited power - only accepted commitments matter.

**Example:** A transporter issues “100 rides” in vouchers. The network only accepts 40 rides worth at a time (credit access). If 15 rides are currently outstanding (debt), then backing capacity = 40 − 15 = 25 rides worth of additional safe acceptance.
