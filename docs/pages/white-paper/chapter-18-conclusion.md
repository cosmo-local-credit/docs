## **18. Conclusion**

CLC aligns mission-driven liquidity with durable, auditable settlement flows and explicit guardrails. By connecting local production, mutual aid, and lending through interoperable commitment pools (each with clear registries, value indices, swap limits, and accountable stewardship) CLC helps route real redeemable commitments at community scale without relying on opaque leverage. Participants can engage through governance and, where enabled by policy, sCLC provides time-bounded swap access to a defined portion of pooled fees, strengthening resilience through transparency, limits, and shared infrastructure.
