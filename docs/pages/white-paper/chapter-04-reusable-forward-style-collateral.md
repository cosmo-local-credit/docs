## **4. Reusable Forward-Style Collateral**

When debt is collateralized by **fungible, tradable vouchers** (reusable gift cards or production forwards):



* Collateral becomes liquid and discoverable across pools,
* Obligations are absorbed by those best placed to fulfill them,
* Default risk decreases as redemption paths multiply,
* Throughput (and fee generation) increases for LPs **without raising leverage**.


### 4.1 Producer Credit Loop (Loan Repayment via Curated Vouchers)

CLC enables a form of producer credit where a loan can be repaid through real-world delivery:



1. A producer (or service provider) issues a voucher: a redeemable claim on their future output (e.g., “10 taxi rides,” “50kg maize,” “10 labor-hours”).
2. A pool steward lists (“curates”) that voucher, publishes limits, fees, valuation policy, and the guarantee structure (e.g., reserve policy and/or guarantor bond and an SLA).
3. A lender (or LP program) provides stablecoins into the pool or into a designated credit facility, receiving the producer’s curated vouchers as collateral (or as the primary repayment instrument).
    1. Note **:** the lender is not stuck holding a private IOU. They hold vouchers that other people actually want (because they’re redeemable), and those vouchers can be swapped/routed across curated pools - so collateral is more liquid. Meanwhile, the borrower can repay by delivering what they produce, and every redemption reduces their outstanding obligation.
    2. 
4. Consumers purchase or accept those vouchers within curated markets they trust. When consumers redeem (or when vouchers are routed and settled), the producer fulfills in-kind.
5. Critically: voucher settlement reduces the producer’s outstanding obligations. The system can route proceeds/receipts so that settlement activity accelerates the producer’s debt payoff—meaning “anyone” who buys/redeems the voucher helps retire the producer’s debt faster (with pool fees funding the curation + routing infrastructure).
6. Redemptions reduce outstanding obligations of voucher issuers; receipts reference voucher class, SLA, and any applicable guarantee.

This turns repayment from “wait for cash” into “get fulfilled by real delivery,” while preserving clear limits, inventories, receipts, and recourse.

**Mini example:** A producer receives $1,000 working capital. They issue $1,000 worth of “maize vouchers.” As those vouchers are bought and redeemed, the producer’s outstanding obligation falls - so end-user purchases directly retire the loan. As demand for the vouchers increases (more people swapping into them), more redemptions occur - so the loan amortizes through real customer usage, not only through cash repayments.
