# Examples

## Audience examples

### Pool stewards (local curators)
You run a market or co-op and want to list a clinic voucher, publish limits, and compare redemption performance with other pools. The network helps route demand into your listings while keeping your governance local.

### Lenders & liquidity providers
You provide stable liquidity and accept curated vouchers as collateral. Routing and clearing increase the chance those vouchers get redeemed, so your capital recycles faster without forcing speculative issuance.

### Producers/borrowers (shops, services, projects)
You take a loan by swapping your already-issued vouchers for lender stables. As customers redeem your vouchers, your outstanding obligations shrink and repayment accelerates.

### Consumers (everyday users)
You hold a food voucher but need transport. Routing finds trusted pools that accept your voucher so you can swap into transport credit and redeem locally.

### Market makers & routers
You operate inventory and routing services. You earn by improving reliability and settlement speed, not by manufacturing speculative volume.

### DAO/policy stewards
You tune waterfall parameters, caps, and insurance targets based on real settlement KPIs, not price volatility.
