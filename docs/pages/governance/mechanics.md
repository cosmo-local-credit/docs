# Governance Mechanics

The CLC DAO will utilize a robust on-chain governance system powered by **OpenZeppelin Governor** smart contracts and managed through the **Tally** platform.

## Overview

Our governance infrastructure ensures transparent, decentralized decision-making for protocol parameters, treasury management, and strategic initiatives. All proposals are executed on-chain with verifiable voting power based on token holdings.

## Technical Stack

### OpenZeppelin Governor

The smart contract layer implements OpenZeppelin's battle-tested [Governor](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/governance) smart contracts.

### Tally Platform

Tally serves as the primary interface for governance participation.
